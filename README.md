# StoraTAG
StoraTAG is an RFID-enabled mass food storage system that could be used to remotely monitor and manage food granaries or cold storage. It helps reduce food waste and improve food mobility and management by allowing us to trace the lifecycle of a sack from the time it enters the storage unit until it exits.
